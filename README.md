# harmony: Self-Harmonizer in Python
Copyright (c) 2019 Bart Massey

This little demo does some basic pitch-shifting and
time-stretching to take a short input audio sample and play
it back in 3-part harmony with a root frequency of 440Hz (A4).

The input is currently hardcoded to be `loop.wav`, which
must be a 48Ksps 16-bit single-channel WAV file. Output is
hardcoded to `harmony.wav`.
